# CryptoDen
CryptoDen is a desktop application that performs text based encryption and decryption using a variety of symmetric ciphers. The ciphers used in this application are categorized into Substitution, Transposition, Combination, Stream, and Block. There are specific ciphers under each category for which this application performs both encryption and decryption. The application is created using Python and for designing the user-interface I have used QT Designer and PyQt5 library.
