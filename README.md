# CryptoDen
CryptoDen is a desktop application that performs data encryption and decryption for all types of symmetric ciphers. The main categories for symmetric ciphers I have in this application are respectively, Substitution, Transposition, Combination, Stream, and Block. There are specific ciphers under each category for which this application performs both encryption and decryption. The application is created using Python and for designing the user-interface I have used QT Designer and PyQt5 library.
